# TimeTrackr

Time tracking application built with Next.js and TailwindCSS.

Employees can log into their account and see all their work shifts.</br>
The employee is able to start and stop a shift which will be logged in a database.

I built this project for myself because i wanted to log my work shifts and track my hours.

Deployment: https://timetrackr-eight.vercel.app
